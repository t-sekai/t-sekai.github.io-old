Hi, I'm Tse-kai Chan, though most people call me Kevin. I'm a second-year undergrad and Regents Scholar studying Computer Science at UC San Diego. I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer graphics, and extended reality.

I'm advised by Professor [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) on robotics and reinforcement learning research. I'm also working at [Qualcomm Institute](https://qi.ucsd.edu) advised by [Neil Smith](https://qi.ucsd.edu/about/leadership/neil-smith/) on AI x XR applications.
